Learning Gradle - Hello World Project

This is a simple project to learn how Gradle works. In this project, we are using Gradle to build and run a basic Java application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

What I am learning:  
-How to set up a Gradle project.  
-How to use Gradle tasks to build and run Java applications.  
-The structure of a Gradle project.
